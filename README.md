# Text-Based-Game
<b> About the Project </b>
This project is a simple text-based game. There are seven locations that each have a unique item and an eighth location where the Wendigo is located. Without knowing the layout of the map, the player must use the commands "north", "south", "east", or "west" to move from location to location to collect the items to defeat the Wendigo. The player wins by collecting all of the items before reaching the Wendigo, or loses by entering the Wendigo's area before all items are collected.
